# Feature: Update the account balance
#   As a client
#   I want to get the latest account balance details
#   So that I can check whether account has sufficient funds

#   Scenario: Account recently created
#     Given a newly created bank account "9890"
#     When a balance update message is received for account "9890" with 8 credits
#     Then the account "9890" should have 8 credits
